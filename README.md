# CS534 Final Project

## Authors
Michael Yen and Jason Yang

## Acknowledgements
This is part of a final project for CS534 at Rutgers University. We aim to perform work to extend that which was accomplished in the paper [**We Learn Better Road Pothole Detection: from Attention Aggregation to Adversarial Domain Adaptation**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06840) by Rui Fan, Hengli Wang, Mohammud J Bocus, and Ming Liu. We will be modifying their original code for our own experiments / research.

Their project page is [here](https://sites.google.com/view/pothole-600) and their original repository location is: https://github.com/hlwang1124/AAFramework

## Setup and Testing
Please see the original authors' github repository for directions on setup and testing.
